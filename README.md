# Ng_ML
Implement the coursera machine learning assignments in python

## ex1
1. linear regression
2. linear regression with multiple variables

note: implement linear regression and get to see it work on data

## ex2
1. logistic regression
2. logistic regression with regularization

note: implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets.

## ex3
1. multiclass classification
2. neural networks prediction function

note: implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

## ex4
1. Neural Networks Learning

note: implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

## ex6
1. support vector machines
2. spam email classifier

note: 1)using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier; 2)use SVMs to build a spam filter.
